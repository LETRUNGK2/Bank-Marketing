# I. Project Overview
This repository apply SQL to analyze dataset which generated from an autonomous bank marketing campaign,which convince customer to agree to terms deposit, and find key insight to develop a more effective strategy for future campaign. 

Key questions should be addressed:
1. Who are more willing to accept term deposit ?
2. How many call attemps should we make to convince customer? 
3. For retargeting customers from previous campaign, what is the successful rate ?

# II. Dataset explaination for initial understanding
- Data described the results from the marketing campaign of financial institutions whether the customers agreed to subscribe to a bank term deposit or not.
- The campaign conducted and recorded by telesales team. 
- The range of records included: customers' profiles which are ages, occupation & marital status, bank balance, housing and loan status, education background. Data from the previous marketing campaign is also included: customers who have not yet called, number of contact from the previous campaign and whether the past campaign was successful or not.

# III. Data field explaination 
Datasets are break down into 3 areas for better understanding: 
-  **Customer Profile** - (age - job - marital - education). When analyzing marketing campaigns, this should take into consideration to find a similar pattern for those customers who agreed to sign up for term deposit
- **Financial Status**: Yearly Balance, housing and loan status are also critical to understand whether the customer has sufficient funds to make terms deposit
- **The Status of the call** (call duration - number of time contacted - number of time re-contacted, call result) could be considered to analyze to find similarity of the call duration both successful and failed  
- Some data field will be modified,dropped and rennamed during data cleaning phase

#  IV. Project Phase
- Phase 1: Inspect and clean Data
- Phase 2: Understand and Build customer segment by conducting descriptive analytic marketing campaign such as customer demographic,
-          campaign outcomes on monthly basis, retargeting attempts. This analytic will be visualized via Power BI
- Phase 3: Diagnostic 
- Phase 4: Predictive analytic is performed to forcast the campaign outcome if we target the the customer's segment that has been identified in phase 2

# V. Project Conclusion
