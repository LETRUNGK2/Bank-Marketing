# II. Dataset explaination for initial understanding
This dataset provides insights into the outcomes of a financial institution's marketing campaign, specifically whether customers agreed to subscribe to a bank term deposit or not.

The campaign was executed and documented by a telesales team. The dataset encompasses a wide range of records, including customer profiles featuring age, occupation, marital status, bank balance, housing and loan status, and educational background. Additionally, it includes data from the previous marketing campaign, such as information on customers who have not yet been contacted, the number of contacts made during the previous campaign, and the success or failure of the past campaign.
